# Terrain_Estimation
Estimating type of surface using GPS data


Obtaining terrain data is in general done through satellite images and further analysis of these images. 
How about making this an easier and cheaper task? A Bicycle and a mobile phone are the most commonly used devices in the world, 
including people who live in remote places. The data collected from a mobile phone can be used for obtaining very useful 
information about the surrounding terrain and type of surface. Data collection is cheaper and economical as well. Estimating the 
type of surface can be useful for many applications such as estimating the rolling resistance, friction coefficient, which is 
otherwise difficult and complex to estimate. This detail can also be included in apps like Google Maps so that users can get to 
know the road condition in a better way.



 Here, we have explored how the path taken by a bicycle rider can be sufficient for mapping the type of surface of the path he took. 
 This can be done by using simple mathematics in an inexpensive way unlike the image processing techniques applied onto the 
 satellite images.
